# bakery-shop
A concept web site for a bakery shop.

Right now I'm focusing on create responsiviness to this site. After that is done, all do minor adjustments to paddings and margins (that's what you get for not doing mobile first).

There are some noticiable glitches on responsiviness, but that is still underway.
